# Transition from Classical to Statistical Mechanics

## Classical Mechanics

We define Lagrangian ($L$)\
$$L = T - V = \frac{m}{2}\dot{q}^2 - V(q,t)$$

Principle of L.A.$\rightarrow$ Classical particle path follows min
action path.

$$\text{Action } S  = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(\dot{q}, q, t) dt$$

$$\delta S = S[\bar{q}+\delta q] - S[\bar{q}] = 0$$

$$\begin{align*}
S[q + \delta q] &= \int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(\dot{q} + \delta \dot{q}, q + \delta q) dt\\
& \text{By Taylor expansion \& discarding higher order terms}\\
&= \int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(\dot{q},q,t) + \delta \dot{q}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}} + \delta q \frac{\partial L}{\partial q} dt\\
&= S[q] + \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \delta \dot{q}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}} + \delta q \frac{\partial L}{\partial q} dt\\
& \boxed{\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial q} = 0} \hspace{50pt}  \text{Lagrange's equation}\\
\end{align*}$$ The last equation is obtained by integration by parts.
Notice there are no variation at both end. This is left as exercise.\
Familiar equation $F = ma$ can be recovered from Lagrange's equation\
$m\frac{d^2q}{dt^2} - \frac{\partial V}{\partial q} = 0$

$$\begin{align*}
L & = T-V\\
&= \frac{1}{2} m\underset{vel}{\underset{\uparrow}{\dot{x}}}^2- \frac{1}{2}kx^2
\end{align*}$$

$$\begin{align*}
 \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial\dot{q}} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial q} &= \frac{d}{dt} m\dot{x} + kx\\
&= m\ddot{x} + kx = 0 \\
& \text{ \hspace{20pt} } \Downarrow \\
& \text{ } \ddot{x} + \left(\frac{k}{m}\right) x = 0
\end{align*}$$

Available solution

$$x(t) = a \cos(\omega t) + b \sin(\omega t)$$

where $\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}$.

## Transistion to Statistical Mechanics

Let's consider $N$ particle system.

Any variations can be described by the

set of coordinates. Each one of these are special and these are called
microstate.

$$\begin{array}{lll}
& \hspace{5pt} (x,y,z) & \hspace{5pt}(p_x, p_y, p_z) \\
& \hspace{5pt}\nearrow & \hspace{5pt}\nearrow \\
microstates := (r^N, p^N) = & (\underbrace{r_1, r_2, \cdots, r_N}_{\text{position}}; & \underbrace{p_1, p_2, \cdots, p_N}_{\text{momenta}}) 
\end{array}$$

Classical mechanics can, in principle, predict the future state of a
system if all $6N$ phase--space coordinates (positions and momenta) and
the equations of motion are known. However, for a chemical system
containing on the order of one mole of particles, tracking all
microscopic variables is practically impossible. Instead, in chemistry
and statistical mechanics, we describe systems using *macroscopic
variables* such as average energy, temperature, and pressure. A
*macrostate* is defined by these macroscopic quantities, while each
macrostate corresponds to a large number of distinct *microstates* that
share the same macroscopic properties. (In statistical mechanics, we
count the number of microstates associated with a given macrostate. A
macrostate with a larger number of microstates is more likely to be
observed.)

This approach is based on the *ergodic hypothesis*, which states that,
over a sufficiently long time, a system evolving according to classical
mechanics spends time in a region of phase space proportional to the
volume of that region. Consequently, time averages along a trajectory
are equivalent to ensemble averages over phase space.\

## Ensemble

Ensemble is a large collection of a system (M systems in the ensemble)
such that\

[Case 1]{.underline} Microcanonical Ensemble (NVE)\
The system is isolated: the total energy $E$, volume $V$, and particle
number $N$ are all fixed. Because the system cannot exchange energy or
particles with the surroundings, every accessible microstate with the
same total energy is equally probable in thermodynamic equilibrium. This
ensemble is conceptually useful when visualizing a perfectly isolated
system.\
[Case 2]{.underline} Canonical Ensemble (NVT)\
Here, $N$ and $V$ are fixed, but the system is allowed to exchange
energy with a much larger heat bath at temperature $T$. As a result, the
system's energy fluctuates around an average value $<E>$. The heat bath
is so large that its temperature remains constant even when it exchanges
energy with the system. To visualize the ensemble, imagine millions of
independent copies of the system, each embedded in an enormous heat
bath. The total energy of "system + bath" is fixed, but the system alone
has fluctuating energy.\
[Case 3]{.underline} NPT Ensemble\
Here, $N$ and $P$ are fixed, but the system is allowed to exchange
energy with a much larger heat bath at temperature $T$. As a result, the
system's energy fluctuates around an average value $<E>$. The heat bath
is so large that its temperature remains constant even when it exchanges
energy with the system. To visualize the ensemble, imagine millions of
independent copies of the system, each embedded in an enormous heat
bath. The total energy of "system + bath" is fixed, but the system alone
has fluctuating energy.\

[Case 4]{.underline} Grand Canonical Ensemble\
The assembly of all microstates with fixed $V$. The energy & \# of each
chemical (molecule A $\uparrow$ molecule B $\downarrow$) can fluctuate,
however and the system is kept at equilibrium by being in contact with a
heat bath at temp $T$.\
Generally, canonical ensemble is referred as $NVT$ ensemble. For the
biological system, we often uses $NPT$ ensemble, and canonical ensemble
are usually referred as $\mu VT$ ensemble. In complex modeling for
biological process, $\mu PT$ ensemble is often used.

## Equilibrium

::: center
<hr/>
  $\star \star$ Equilibrium:     A state of rest or balance due to the equal action of opposing force
                                                             $\Downarrow$
                                            If the system is at equil. then I can't really
                                          tell the difference before & after some time $t$.

In this class (UG version), we exclude almost all topics relates to the
system not in equilibrium.\

The system in Case 1 is considered in equilibrium & process is called
reversible process. In this class(statistical thermodynamics part), we
always treat the system in its equilibrium. Non-equilibrium case should
be treated only in graduate school P-Chem class or research classes.
