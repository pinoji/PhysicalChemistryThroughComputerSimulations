## Maxwell Relation

So far we have $U$, $H$, $A$, $G$ state function of energy.\
Because total derivative of any of these are

exact, we can use mathematical technique called \"Maxwell relation\".\

$$\begin{array}{ll}dA &= \left(\frac{\partial A}{\partial V}\right)_TdV + \left(\frac{\partial A}{\partial T}\right)_VdT \cdots \text{total}\\
dA &= -PdV - SdT
\end{array}$$

then

$$\begin{array}{rcl}
\begin{array}{l}\left(\frac{\partial A}{\partial V}\right)_T = -P\\ \left(\frac{\partial A}{\partial T}\right)_V = -S\end{array}
& \overset{\text{exact}}{\Rightarrow} & \left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial T}\right)_V = \left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial V}\right)_T\\
& & \text{\hspace{30pt}} \downarrow\\
& & \text{ Maxwell relation }
\end{array}$$ [HW]{.underline}\
Obtain all other Maxwell relation.\
$$\begin{array}{c|c|c}
\text{Thermodynamic energy} & \text{Total diff} & \text{Maxwell relation}\\
& & \\
U & dU = TdS-PdV &\left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial V}\right)_S = -\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial S}\right)_V \\
& & \\
H & dH = TdS + VdP & \left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial P}\right)_S = \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial S}\right)_P\\
& & \\
A & dA = -SdT-PdV & \left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial V}\right)_T = \left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial T}\right)_V \\
& & \\
G & dG = -SdT+VdP & \left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial P}\right)_T = -\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_P 
\end{array}$$

$$\begin{align*}
T =\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial S}\right)_V = \left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial S}\right)_P\\
P =-\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial V}\right)_S = -\left(\frac{\partial A}{\partial V}\right)_T\\
S = -\left(\frac{\partial A}{\partial T}\right)_V = -\left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial T}\right)_P\\
V = \left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial P}\right)_S = \left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial P}\right)_T
\end{align*}$$

Example of use of Maxwell relation\
Compute $\Delta S(T,V)$ at const $T$ for ideal gas.\
$$\begin{align*}
\Delta S &= \int_{V_1}^{V_2}\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial V}\right)_TdV\\
& \downarrow \text{ Maxwell }\\
&= \int_{V_1}^{V_2}\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial T}\right)_VdV\\
& \downarrow \text{ Ideal gas }\\
&=\int_{V_1}^{V_2}\frac{nR}{V}dV\\
&= nR \ln \frac{V_2}{V_1} \hspace{20pt} \text{ isothermal process }
\end{align*}$$

## Example of Basic Thermodynamic Process

We have already discussed that the internal energy $U$ is a state
function. We also showed that the *natural variables* of $U$ are the
entropy $S$ and the volume $V$, so that $U = U(S,V)$ and
$$dU = T\, dS - P\, dV.$$ Starting from this expression, we can use
Maxwell relations to rewrite $U$ in terms of different variables. In
particular, we now derive an expression for $U$ as a function of
temperature $T$ and volume $V$.

To do this, we want to re-express $dS$ in terms of $dT$ and $dV$. We
consider entropy $S$ as a function of $T$ and $V$: $$S = S(T,V).$$ Thus
its total differential is $$dS = 
\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial T}\right)_V dT
+
\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial V}\right)_T dV.$$ Substituting this
into $dU = T\, dS - P\, dV$ gives $$dU = 
T\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial T}\right)_V dT
+
T\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial V}\right)_T dV
- P\, dV.$$

### Using the definition of heat capacity {#using-the-definition-of-heat-capacity .unnumbered}

From previous HW problem, the heat capacity at constant volume is
$$C_V = T\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial T}\right)_V.$$ Therefore,
$$dU = C_V\, dT 
+ T\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial V}\right)_T dV
- P\, dV.$$

### Using a Maxwell relation {#using-a-maxwell-relation .unnumbered}

From the Helmholtz free energy,
$$A = U - TS, \qquad dA = -S\, dT - P\, dV,$$ we obtain the Maxwell
relation $$\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial V}\right)_T
=
\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial T}\right)_V.$$ Substituting this into
our expression for $dU$, we obtain $$dU = C_V\, dT
+ T\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial T}\right)_V dV
- P\, dV.$$

Thus, the general expression is $$\boxed{
dU = C_V\, dT + 
\bigg[\, T\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial T}\right)_V - P \bigg] dV.
}$$

### Simplification for an ideal gas {#simplification-for-an-ideal-gas .unnumbered}

For an ideal gas, $$P = \frac{nRT}{V}.$$ Therefore,
$$\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial T}\right)_V
= \frac{nR}{V},
\qquad
T\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial T}\right)_V = \frac{nRT}{V} = P.$$

Hence the bracketed term vanishes:
$$T\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial T}\right)_V - P = 0.$$

So for an ideal gas, $$\boxed{
dU = C_V\, dT.
}$$

This result shows that the internal energy of an ideal gas depends only
on its temperature and not on its volume. Let's think this in terms of
physics.\
Internal energy ($U$) is the energy contained in the system (i.e.
translations, rotations, vibrations of each molecule in the system). The
internal energy is the energy of the whole system excluding the
potential energy and kinetic enregy of the whole system. In other words,
internal energy U does not depend on any variable associated with center
of mass of the system. In fact, internal energy is a function of
relative coordinates $\left( x^{3N-3},p^{3N-3} \right)_{CM}$ of the
particles cointained in the system. In general, internal energy often
depends on volume as well as temperature. However, $U$ for an ideal gas
(translation, rotation, vibration) is not affected by other molecules
because ideal gas does not possess any intermolecular interaction. Since
ideal gas system is composed of completely independent molecules by
definition, volume has no effect to those the energy contained in the
system (i.e. translations, rotations, vibrations of each molecule in the
system). In general, ideal gas are assumed to have zero vibrational $\&$
rotational energies. Although there is no ideal gas found in nature, He
gas is considered to be close to an ideal gas system.\

## Work and Heat in a Cyclic Process

To understand the behavior of the internal energy $U$, as well as heat
$q$ and work $w$, let us examine a simple cyclic process in the $T$--$V$
plane. Assume the system is an ideal gas with constant heat capacity
$C_V = \frac{3}{2}k_B$ (monatomic ideal gas).

The cycle consists of four steps:

$$\begin{align*}
&1.\ \textbf{Isothermal expansion} 
        && (T_1, V_1) \rightarrow (T_1, V_2) 
        && \text{(expansion at constant temperature)} \\
&2.\ \textbf{Isochoric heating}    
        && (T_1, V_2) \rightarrow (T_2, V_2) 
        && \text{(temperature increases at constant volume)} \\
&3.\ \textbf{Isothermal compression} 
        && (T_2, V_2) \rightarrow (T_2, V_1) 
        && \text{(compression at constant temperature)} \\
&4.\ \textbf{Isochoric cooling}    
        && (T_2, V_1) \rightarrow (T_1, V_1) 
        && \text{(temperature decreases at constant volume)}
\end{align*}$$

[**HW**]{.underline}\
For each step, compute the work $w$ and heat $q$ transferred. Use the
ideal gas law and the expressions $$w = -\int P_{\mathrm{ext}}\, dV,
\qquad
dU = C_V\, dT \qquad (\text{ideal gas}).$$

### Expected Results {#expected-results .unnumbered}

$$\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
&\textbf{Step 1 (isothermal expansion)} \\
& w_1 = -n k_B T_1 \ln\!\left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right), 
\qquad
q_1 = +n k_B T_1 \ln\!\left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right), \\[6pt]
&\textbf{Step 2 (isochoric heating)} \\
& w_2 = 0,
\qquad
q_2 = \frac{3}{2} n k_B (T_2 - T_1), \\[6pt]

&\textbf{Step 4 (isochoric cooling)} \\
& w_4 = 0,
\qquad
q_4 = \frac{3}{2} n k_B (T_1 - T_2).
\end{aligned}
}$$

[**HW:**]{.underline} Add up $w_1 + w_2 + w_3 + w_4$ and
$q_1 + q_2 + q_3 + q_4$ over the entire cycle. Show that neither the
total work nor the total heat is zero, even though the system returns to
its initial state $(T_1, V_1)$.

### Conclusion {#conclusion .unnumbered}

At the end of the cycle, the system has returned to its original state,
so its internal energy is unchanged: $$\Delta U_{\text{cycle}} = 0.$$
Therefore, from the first law of thermodynamics,
$$\sum q_i + \sum w_i = 0.$$

However, the **individual values** of $\sum q_i$ and $\sum w_i$ depend
on *the specific path taken in the $T$--$V$ plane*. A different cycle
connecting the same starting and ending point would give different total
heats and works.

$$\boxed{
\text{Since } q_{\text{cycle}} \text{ and } w_{\text{cycle}} \text{ depend on the path},
\quad
q \text{ and } w \text{ are not state functions.}
}$$

This example demonstrates that only $U$ (and other thermodynamic
potentials with natural variables) are state functions, while $q$ and
$w$ are path dependent.

## Second Law of Thermodynamics

Up to this point, we have defined entropy only for **reversible**
processes. For a reversible change, we showed
$$dS = \frac{\delta q_{\mathrm{rev}}}{T},$$ and therefore $S$ is a state
function.

However, most real processes in nature are **irreversible**: friction,
rapid expansion, heat flow across a finite temperature difference, and
so on. During an irreversible process, the system is not in equilibrium,
and describing such nonequilibrium states statistically is extremely
difficult. Thus, we remain within classical thermodynamics and compare
any real process to a hypothetical reversible path between the same
initial and final equilibrium states.

**Irreversible work is always larger in magnitude than reversible work**

Consider the work term $$w = -\int P_{\text{ext}}\, dV.$$ For a
reversible process, $P_{\text{ext}}$ is always adjusted so that
$P_{\text{ext}} = P_{\text{sys}}$. For an irreversible expansion,
$P_{\text{ext}} < P_{\text{sys}}$, and the system does less (more
negative) work in magnitude. Thus,
$$w_{\mathrm{irr}} > w_{\mathrm{rev}} \quad \text{(expansion)}.$$

A similar argument for compression ($P_{\text{ext}} > P_{\text{sys}}$)
again yields $$w_{\mathrm{irr}} > w_{\mathrm{rev}}.$$ Therefore, for any
process, $$w_{\mathrm{irr}} > w_{\mathrm{rev}}.$$

**Consequences for heat: the Clausius inequality**

Because internal energy is a state function,
$$dU = w_{\mathrm{irr}} + q_{\mathrm{irr}}
      = w_{\mathrm{rev}} + q_{\mathrm{rev}}.$$ Since
$w_{\mathrm{irr}} > w_{\mathrm{rev}}$, the reversible path must transfer
more heat: $$q_{\mathrm{rev}} > q_{\mathrm{irr}}.$$

Using the definition of entropy for the reversible path,
$$dS = \frac{\delta q_{\mathrm{rev}}}{T},$$ we obtain the **Clausius
inequality** for irreversible processes: $$dS \ge \frac{\delta q}{T},$$
with equality only for reversible processes.

Integrating around a cycle gives the engineering form of the Second Law:
$$\oint \frac{\delta q}{T} \le 0.$$

**Statement of the Second Law**

For an isolated system ($\delta q = 0$),
$$dS_{\text{isolated}} > 0 \qquad \text{(irreversible process)}.$$ Thus,

> **The entropy of an isolated system never decreases during a
> spontaneous process. It remains constant only for reversible
> processes.**

## Third Law of Thermodynamics

Every substance has a finite positive entropy, but at 0K the entropy may
become 0, and it does so in case of a perfect crystalline substance.\

From $dU=C_VdT=TdS-PdV$, you obtain

$$\begin{array}{ll}
\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial T}\right)_V &= \frac{C_V}{T}\\
\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial V}\right)_T &= \frac{1}{T}\left[P + \left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial V}\right)_T\right]
\end{array}$$

$$\begin{array}{ll}
dS &= \left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial T}\right)_VdT + \left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial V}\right)_TdV\\
& \downarrow \text{ const } V\\
&= \frac{C_V}{T}dT
\end{array}$$

At low $T$,

Note this is not $C_V$.\
So we need the other formula.\
$dH = TdS + VdP$

$$\left.
\begin{array} {l}
\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial T}\right)_P = \frac{C_P(T)}{T}\\
\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial P}\right)_T = \frac{1}{T}\left[\left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial P}\right)_T - V\right]
\end{array}
\right\}

$\Delta S = \int_{T_1}^{T_2}\frac{C_P(T)}{T} dT$\
Now you can plug in Debye's expression and see what happens to $S$ at
lower temperature.\
