# Free Energy, Pressure, $\&$ Gas Laws

## Helmholtz Free Energy

$$\begin{align*}
S &= -k_B\sum \mathbb{P}_i\ln \mathbb{P}_i\\
& \text{Since $\ln {\mathbb{P}_i}=-(\beta E_i + \ln Z)$}\\
&= -k_B\sum \mathbb{P}_i(-\beta E_i - \ln Z)\\
&= k_B\beta <E> + k_B \ln Z\\
\end{align*}$$

Because we established $\beta=\frac{1}{k_BT}$, plug this back into
expression of $S$\
$$\begin{align*}
& S= \frac{E}{T} + k_B \ln Z \hspace{10pt} \\
&A=\underbrace{E - TS}_{\Downarrow} = -k_B T \ln Z = -\beta^{-1} \ln Z\\
&\text{Often denote as A and is called Helmholtz free energy.}\\
&\text{(This quantity is often used in thermodynamics.)}
\end{align*}$$

## Gibbs Free Energy

$$\begin{align*}
S &= -k_B\sum \mathbb{P}_i\ln \mathbb{P}_i\\
& \text{Since $\ln {\mathbb{P}_i}=-(\beta E_i+ \beta PV_i+ \ln \Delta)$}\\
&= -k_B\sum \mathbb{P}_i(-\beta E_i -\beta PV_i  - \ln \Delta)\\
&= k_B\beta (<E> +P<V>) + k_B \ln \Delta\\
\end{align*}$$

Because we established $\beta=\frac{1}{k_BT}$, plug this back into
expression of $S$\
$$\begin{align*}
& S= \frac{E+PV}{T}  + k_B \ln \Delta \hspace{10pt} \\
&G=\underbrace{E - TS+PV}_{\Downarrow} = -k_B T \ln \Delta = -\beta^{-1} \ln \Delta\\
&\text{Often denote as G and is called Gibbs free energy.}\\
&\text{(This quantity is central in thermodynamics of biology.)}
\end{align*}$$

## Enthalpy

We can derive enthalpy starting from the statistical definition of
entropy: $$S = -k_B \sum_i \mathbb{P}_i \ln \mathbb{P}_i.$$

Suppose the system can exchange energy with the surroundings, and also
do pressure-volume work. For each microstate $i$, the probability is
$$\mathbb{P}_i = \frac{1}{\Delta} e^{-\beta (E_i + P V_i)},$$ where
$\Delta = \sum_j e^{-\beta (E_j + P V_j)}$ is the canonical partition
function for the isobaric ensemble ($T,P$ fixed).

Then $$\begin{align*}
S &= -k_B \sum_i \mathbb{P}_i \ln \mathbb{P}_i \\
  &= -k_B \sum_i \mathbb{P}_i \Big[-\beta(E_i + P V_i) - \ln \Delta \Big] \\
  &= k_B \beta \sum_i \mathbb{P}_i (E_i + P V_i) + k_B \ln \Delta \\
  &= k_B \beta \langle E + P V \rangle + k_B \ln \Delta,
\end{align*}$$ where $\langle \cdot \rangle$ denotes the ensemble
average.

Since $\beta = 1/(k_B T)$, we can write
$$S = \frac{\langle E + P V \rangle}{T} + k_B \ln \Delta.$$

Up to this point, it is identical to previous page. Now define the
enthalpy $H$ as $$H \equiv \langle E + P V \rangle.$$

Then we can express $H$ in terms of the partition function:
$$H = T S - k_B T \ln \Delta.$$

Last term on the RHS is Gibbs free energy, so $$H - T S = G=E - TS+PV$$
Hence, $$H =E +PV$$ and $$dH =-PdV+TdS +PdV+Vdp=TdS+VdP$$

#### Key points:

- This mirrors the derivation of Gibbs free energy
  $G = U - TS + PV = - k_B T \ln \Delta$.

- Enthalpy naturally arises as the ensemble average of energy plus $PV$
  for the isobaric ensemble.

- Differential form: $$dH = T\, dS + V\, dP,$$ so the natural variables
  of $H$ are $S$ and $P$, just as the natural variables of $G$ are $T$
  and $P$.

#### Summary:

$$\boxed{H = U + PV = \langle E + P V \rangle}, \quad
dH = T\,dS + V\,dP.$$

Enthalpy is the thermodynamic potential that is most useful for
processes at constant pressure, just as Gibbs free energy is most useful
for processes at constant temperature and pressure.\

& & \underset{C_P}{\underset{\downarrow}{\frac{dH}{dT}}} = \underset{C_V}{\underset{\downarrow}{\frac{dU}{dT}}} + nR
\end{array}$$

# Legendre Transforms and the Helmholtz Free Energy {#legendre-transforms-and-the-helmholtz-free-energy .unnumbered}

Free energy represents the portion of a system's internal energy that is
available to perform work. In the case of the **Helmholtz free energy**,
this quantity corresponds to the energy available to do (typically
non-$PV$) work under conditions of constant temperature and constant
volume.

The Helmholtz free energy is defined as $$A = U - TS,$$ which is
obtained by subtracting the term $TS$ from the internal energy $U$.
Because $U$ and $TS$ are both path-independent state functions, their
combination is also a state function. The appearance of the negative
sign in the definition of $A$ follows from the physics of thermodynamic
consistency.

This construction is an example of a **Legendre transform**, introduced
in an earlier chapter. In thermodynamics, the Legendre transform of a
function $f(x)$ is typically written as $$\tilde{f}(p) = f(x) - px,$$
where $(x, p)$ is a pair of conjugate variables. The extra negative sign
in the Legendre transform has physical meaning: it replaces one natural
variable with its conjugate while preserving the thermodynamic
structure. In doing so, it subtracts the entropy--heat term $TS$ from
the internal energy, leaving the Helmholtz free energy. This quantity
represents the portion of the system's energy that is actually available
to perform useful work at constant temperature.\
[Important point]{.underline}: We use Legendre transform because we want
to exchange variable(difficult to manage experimentally) to more usable
one for each experiment.\
To perform Legendre transform, convexity of the function w.r.t. variable
x has to be satisfied. This is a great exercise so make sure to finish
the HW at the end of this section.\
[Another important point]{.underline}: As shown in previous section, we
use the same partition function $Z$as canonical ensemble (review
partition function for NVT). However, for NPT ensemble, the partition
function is different as described before(review partition function for
NPT). Using correct partition function is critical for computational
chemist.\

### About conjugate pair {#about-conjugate-pair .unnumbered}

The products $TS$ and $PV$ are special because they are *conjugate
pairs*: $$T \leftrightarrow S, \qquad P \leftrightarrow V.$$ Each pair
consists of an intensive variable ($T$ or $P$) multiplied by its
extensive counterpart ($S$ or $V$), and their products have units of
energy. This allows us to use them to transform one energy
representation into another. For example, applying a Legendre transform
to replace the natural variable $S$ in $U(S,V)$ yields the Helmholtz
free energy $A(T,V)$.

It is essential that both $TS$ and $PV$ are path-independent state
functions. Therefore, adding or subtracting these quantities to
construct new thermodynamic potentials always produces valid state
functions. Each potential simply uses a different set of natural
variables chosen to match a particular experimental setup.

Finally, while we have not yet provided the general proof that the
internal energy $U$ is a state function, a concise proof is given in the
following page after homework.

## Pressure from Helmholtz Free Energy

In this page, we prove some equation that is used in the Pressure
derivation. Let us consider the isentropic process where the entropy is
constant through out the process. This means process is adiabatic as
well as reversible. In that case,

The Helmholtz free energy is defined as $$A(T,V) = E - TS.$$

Its differential is $$dA = dE - TdS - SdT.$$

For a closed system (no particle exchange), the first law gives
$$dE = TdS - PdV.$$

Substituting into the differential of $A$:
$$dA = (TdS - PdV) - TdS - SdT = -PdV - SdT.$$

Since $A = A(T,V)$, we can also write the differential explicitly in
terms of partial derivatives:
$$dA = \left(\frac{\partial A}{\partial V}\right)_T dV + \left(\frac{\partial A}{\partial T}\right)_V dT.$$

Comparing the two expressions for $dA$, we immediately identify
$$\left(\frac{\partial A}{\partial V}\right)_T = -P, \quad 
\left(\frac{\partial A}{\partial T}\right)_V = -S.$$

Thus, the pressure is given by
$$\boxed{P = -\left(\frac{\partial A}{\partial V}\right)_T}.$$

**Optional: Statistical Mechanics Connection.**

In the canonical ensemble, $A$ is related to the partition function $Z$
via $$A = -k_B T \ln Z,$$ so that
$$P = -\left(\frac{\partial A}{\partial V}\right)_T
  = k_B T \left(\frac{\partial \ln Z}{\partial V}\right)_T.$$

## Entropy is a State Function

In this section, we demonstrate that entropy $S$ is a state function by
showing that the differential
$$dS = \frac{1}{T}\left( dU + P\,dV \right)$$ is *exact*. We will use
the canonical ensemble, where the partition function $Z(T,V)$ is defined
as
$$Z(T,V) = \sum_j e^{-\beta E_j(V)}, \qquad \beta = \frac{1}{k_B T}.$$

### Step 1: Express thermodynamic quantities in terms of $Z$ {#step-1-express-thermodynamic-quantities-in-terms-of-z .unnumbered}

From statistical mechanics we know:
$$P = k_B T \left( \frac{\partial \ln Z}{\partial V} \right)_{T},
\qquad
U = - \frac{\partial \ln Z}{\partial \beta}.$$

The heat term at constant volume is
$$\delta q_{\text{rev}} = dU + P\,dV.$$ Thus the entropy differential is
$$dS = \frac{1}{T}\left( dU + P\,dV \right).$$

Write it in terms of $T$ and $V$: $$dS = M(T,V)\,dT + N(T,V)\,dV,$$
where $$M = \frac{1}{T}\left( \frac{\partial U}{\partial T} \right)_V,
\qquad
N = \frac{1}{T}\left( \frac{\partial U}{\partial V} \right)_T + \frac{P}{T}.$$

To show $S$ is a state function, it is enough to show the mixed partials
match:
$$\frac{\partial M}{\partial V} = \frac{\partial N}{\partial T}.$$

### Step 2: Compute $N(T,V)$ explicitly {#step-2-compute-ntv-explicitly .unnumbered}

Use $U = -\partial_\beta \ln Z$:
$$\left( \frac{\partial U}{\partial V} \right)_T
= -\frac{\partial}{\partial V}\frac{\partial\ln Z}{\partial\beta}
= -\frac{\partial^2 \ln Z}{\partial V \partial \beta}.$$

Therefore, $$N(T,V)
= \frac{1}{T}\left( -\frac{\partial^2 \ln Z}{\partial V \partial \beta} \right)
+ \frac{1}{T}\left( k_B T \frac{\partial \ln Z}{\partial V} \right)
= -\frac{1}{T}\frac{\partial^2 \ln Z}{\partial V \partial \beta}
+ k_B\frac{\partial \ln Z}{\partial V}.$$

### Step 3: Differentiate $N(T,V)$ with respect to $T$ {#step-3-differentiate-ntv-with-respect-to-t .unnumbered}

Here we provide full detail, including the part that "conveniently
disappears.''

$$N(T,V)=\frac{1}{T}\Big(-\frac{\partial^2\ln Z}{\partial V\partial\beta}\Big)
+ k_B\frac{\partial\ln Z}{\partial V}.$$

Differentiate each part.

#### (a) Derivative of the first term using the product rule:

$$\frac{\partial}{\partial T}
\left[
\frac{1}{T}\left( -\frac{\partial^2\ln Z}{\partial V\partial\beta} \right)
\right]
=
-\frac{1}{T^2}\Big(-\frac{\partial^2\ln Z}{\partial V\partial\beta}\Big)
+\frac{1}{T}\left(-\frac{\partial}{\partial T}\frac{\partial^2\ln Z}{\partial V\partial\beta}\right).$$

Use
$$\frac{\partial}{\partial T} = -\frac{1}{k_B T^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial \beta}.$$

Thus
$$\frac{1}{T}\left(-\frac{\partial}{\partial T}\frac{\partial^2\ln Z}{\partial V\partial\beta}\right)
=
\frac{1}{k_B T^3}\frac{\partial^3\ln Z}{\partial V\partial\beta^2}.$$

The full contribution becomes
$$\frac{1}{T^2}\frac{\partial^2\ln Z}{\partial V\partial\beta}
+
\frac{1}{k_B T^3}\frac{\partial^3\ln Z}{\partial V\partial\beta^2}.$$

#### (b) Derivative of the second term:

$$\frac{\partial}{\partial T}\left[k_B\frac{\partial\ln Z}{\partial V}\right]
=
k_B\frac{\partial^2\ln Z}{\partial V\partial T}
=
k_B\left(-\frac{1}{k_B T^2}\right)
\frac{\partial^2\ln Z}{\partial V\partial\beta}
=
-\frac{1}{T^2}\frac{\partial^2\ln Z}{\partial V\partial\beta}.$$

#### (c) Cancellation

When we add results from (a) and (b), the $1/T^2$ terms cancel:
$$\frac{\partial N}{\partial T}
=
\frac{1}{k_B T^3}
\frac{\partial^3\ln Z}{\partial V\partial\beta^2}.$$

### Step 4: Compute $\partial M / \partial V$ and compare {#step-4-compute-partial-m-partial-v-and-compare .unnumbered}

Similarly,
$$M = \frac{1}{T}\left( \frac{\partial U}{\partial T} \right)_V
= \frac{1}{T}\left( -\frac{\partial}{\partial T}\frac{\partial\ln Z}{\partial\beta}\right).$$

Using $\partial/\partial T = -\frac{1}{k_B T^2}\partial_\beta$,
$$M=\frac{1}{k_B T^3}\frac{\partial^2\ln Z}{\partial\beta^2}.$$

Now differentiate with respect to $V$: $$\frac{\partial M}{\partial V}
=
\frac{1}{k_B T^3}
\frac{\partial^3\ln Z}{\partial V\partial\beta^2}.$$

This matches exactly the expression above:
$$\frac{\partial M}{\partial V}
=
\frac{\partial N}{\partial T}.$$

### Conclusion {#conclusion .unnumbered}

Since $$\frac{\partial M}{\partial V} = \frac{\partial N}{\partial T},$$
the differential $dS = M\,dT + N\,dV$ is *exact*. Therefore, entropy $S$
is a **state function**.

[HW]{.underline}\
Let $K=PV$, and $dK=d(PV)=\cdots$\
Show this expression is exact. repeat the same process for the variable
pair $TS$.\
Since all of these $P, V, T$ are intuitively obvious that they are state
variable, and now we established $S$ is also state variable, any
combination of these will be a state function. However, this is still a
good simlpe exercise.\
[HW]{.underline}\
Let us perform our first Legendre transformation where you want to
change the variable of energy from S and V to V and T. Start with 1st
law $dU=-PdV+TdS$ and take the differential of $A=U-TS$ to obtain
$dA=-pdV-SdT$. Differential form of 1st law identify its natural
variable $U(V,S)$ and differential form of Helmholtz free energy
identify its natural variable as $A(V,T)$\
[HW]{.underline}\
We are now going to justify the Legendre transformation from U to A. We
need to show that U is convex w.r.t. S. Using the differential form of
1st law, what is the $\left( \frac{\partial U}{\partial S}\right)_V$?\
[HW]{.underline}\
Following the previous question, what is the
$\left( \frac{\partial T}{\partial S}\right)_V$ is equivalent to? \[hint

[HW]{.underline}\
Following the previous question, by chain rule,

What $X$ would make the best choice? \[hint second derivative in
previous problem $> 0$ to make U convex w.r.t. S\]\
[HW]{.underline}\
Wat is $\left( \frac{\partial X}{\partial T}\right)_V$?\
[HW]{.underline}\
What is $\left( \frac{\partial S}{\partial X}\right)_V$?\
[HW]{.underline}\
Are those partial derivative positive? If both are positive, what can
you say about convexity of U w.r.t. S?\
[HW]{.underline}\
Just like the last 6 questions, what can you say about convexity of A
w.r.t. V? \[hint: use isothermal compressibility defined in previous
chapter\]\
[HW]{.underline} 2nd part.\
Plug the partition function Z into the LHS of the equation and take the
second derivative w.r.t. $\beta$. You should get two terms. What are
those?(These should look familiar to you). Then, what does the LHS of
the equation really mean?

[HW]{.underline}\
Using previous HW, computed the standard deviation. Then, compare the
ratio of $\frac{stdev}{<E>}$. Both variance of energy is linearly
proportional to N(number of particles in the system) since it has Cv
term in there. Also, energy is linearly proportional to N. Then, as the
system size increase(i.e. 1 mol) what happens to the error
(stdev/energy)?

## Using Euler Equation to prove $U$ is a state function

We have shown that $S$ and $V$ is extensive variables and $U$ is
extensive function of these variables. More specifically, all of these
are additive (linear relation to size). For this reason, it is obvious
that following relation holds\
$$\ U(aS,aV)=aU(S,V)$$ This equation can interprit as \"if the new
system has twice the volume (a=2) and entropy per volume is unchanged,
internal energy is twice as large as original system.\" Then, it follwos
that\
$$\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
 \frac{dU(aS,aV)}{da}&=U(S,V)\\
&=\left( \frac{\partial U(aS,aV)}{\partial (aS)}     \right)_V \frac{d \left(aS\right)}{da}+\left( \frac{\partial U(aS,aV)}{\partial (aV)}     \right)_S \frac{d \left(aV\right)}{da}\\
&=\left( \frac{\partial U(aS,aV)}{\partial (aS)}     \right)_V S+\left( \frac{\partial U(aS,aV)}{\partial (aV)}     \right)_S V\\
& \text{by setting a=1}\\
&=\left( \frac{\partial U(S,V)}{\partial S}\right)_V S+\left( \frac{\partial U(S,V)}{\partial V}     \right)_S V\\
& \text{from 1st law} \\
& dU(S,T)=\left( \frac{\partial U(S,V)}{\partial S}\right)_VdS+\left( \frac{\partial U(S,V)}{\partial V}\right)_SdV=\delta q+ \delta w =Tds-Pdv\\
& \text{ first and second partial derivatives are $T$ and  $-P$, respectively }\\
& U= TS-PV\\
\end{split}
\end{equation*}$$ It folllows from the HW in the previous page, U is a
state function. This argument can be repeated for $U(S,V,N)$.\

## More on the First Laws of Thermodynamics

We have proved that total differential $du$ is exact. So how does this
path-independent imply that energy conservation?\

$u$ is path-independent. $\Rightarrow$ conservation of energy (Energy

## Ideal gas law

Let us think about the meaning of partition function. When you are
taking average value of $x$, you are putting $x$ in front of $p(x)$.
More precisely, $x \times events$ divide by the total events. What if
you put 1 in front of $p(x)$ instead? You are simply counting the number
of possible outcome. For example, average of exam score is obtained by
the number of students who got same score multiplied by the score.
Instead, if you replace the score by unity, you are just counting the
number of student in the class which eventually serves as a
normalization constant. It is really not too obvious from Boltzmann
distribution, but we are counting the number of states having
$\epsilon_i$ and summing over all possible i. In similar philosophy, the
partition function in classical mechanics is defined over all possible
value of position and momenta which satisfy the energy term $H(p,q)$.
$h^{3}$ is a volume occupied by each state (see previous chapter or
appendix). But this goes away when you integrate w.r.t. q and p.\
$$\begin{align*}
Z &= \sum\limits_i e^{-\epsilon_i/k_BT}\\
&=\frac{1}{h^{3N}N!} \int\int dq^{3N}dp^{3N} e^{-\left(\frac{p_1^2}{2m}+\frac{p_2^2}{2m} + \cdots + \frac{p_{3N}^2}{2m}\right)/k_BT}\\
&= \frac{V^N}{N!}\underbrace{\left(\int e^\frac{-p^2}{2m/k_BT} dp\right)^{3N}}_{\text{This term does not depend on volume. Call this } f(\beta).}
\end{align*}$$ We pretended that we did actual integration in the above
equation so $h^{3N}$ term disappear from the expression.\
$$\begin{align*}
\ln Z &= N\ln V + \ln f(\beta) - \ln N!
\end{align*}$$

$$\frac{\partial \ln Z}{\partial V}\Big|_T = \frac{N}{V}$$

$$P= \beta^{-1} \frac{\partial \ln Z}{\partial V}\Big|_T = k_B T\frac{N}{V}$$

There we have
