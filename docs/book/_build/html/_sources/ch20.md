# Chemical Potential

We are going to make a shift from one component system to
multi-component system. Chemical potential is useful tool for the
multi-component system and it play a central role in chemical
thermodynamics. Relation to Lagrange multipliers are explained in the
appendix if readers are intersted. It is important that index i used in
the definition of chemical potential corresponds to thei-th component in
the system.\

## Definition and variation in chemical potential

Chemical Potential (const $T$ & $V$)\
$A = -\beta^{-1}\ln Z$\
We consider total derivative.\
$$\begin{align*}
dA &= -SdT-PdV+\sum\limits_i\mu dn_i\\
&=\left(\frac{\partial A}{\partial T}\right)_{V,N}dT+\left(\frac{\partial A}{\partial V}\right)_{T,N}dV + \sum\limits_i\left(\frac{\partial A}{\partial n_i}\right)_{T,V}dn_i
\end{align*}$$

$\uparrow$

Note that $T$ & $V$ must be const.

$\left(\frac{\partial A}{\partial n_i}\right)_{T,V,n_{J+1}} = \mu_i$

$||$

$-\beta^{-1}\left(\frac{\partial \ln Z}{\partial n_i}\right)_{T,V}$\
For mono atomic ideal gas composed of 2 type with type 1 having n
particles and type 2 having m particles\
$$\begin{align*}
\ln Z &= n\ln V + n\ln f(\beta)-\ln n!+m\ln V + m\ln f(\beta)-\ln m!\\
&= n\ln V + n\ln f(\beta) - n\ln n + n+m\ln V + m\ln f(\beta) - m\ln m + m\\
\end{align*}$$
$$\left(\frac{\partial \ln Z}{\partial n}\right)_{T,V} = \ln V -\ln n - 1 + 1 +\ln f(\beta)$$
result in\
$\mu_i = \beta^{-1}\ln \frac{n}{V} f(\beta)$

[HW]{.underline}\
Show for the system composed of many type,\
$$\left(\frac{\partial \ln Z}{\partial n_i}\right)_{T,V} = \ln V -\ln n_i +\ln f(\beta)$$
$\mu_i = \beta^{-1}\ln \frac{n_i}{V} f(\beta)$

From

$$\mu_i = k_BT\ln \left(\frac{n_i}{V}f(\beta)\right) = k_BT\ln \left(\rho_i f(\beta)\right)$$

$\begin{array}{rl}
\text{as }n_i\uparrow & \mu \uparrow\\
V\uparrow & \mu \downarrow\\
T\uparrow & \mu \uparrow\\
\underset{\uparrow}{\rho_i} \uparrow &\mu \uparrow\\
\text{particle} & \\
\text{density} & 
\end{array}$

[HW]{.underline}\
Starting with following Z, derive the chemical potential for single
component monoatimic ideal gas system\
$$Z=\frac{1}{N!}\left[q_\text{trans}\right]^N = \frac{1}{N!}\left[\left(\frac{2\pi mk_BT}{h^2}\right)^{3/2}V\right]^N$$

Chemical Potential (const $T$ & $P$)\
$$\begin{align*}
dG &= \left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial T}\right)_{P,n_J}dT + \left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial P}\right)_{T,n_J}dP + \sum\limits_i \left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial n_i}\right)_{T,P,n_J}dn_i\\
&= -SdT+VdP+\sum\limits_i\mu_idn_i\\
\end{align*}$$

This case $\mu_i=\left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial n}\right)_{T,P,n_J}$\
Chemical Potential (const $S$ & $V$)\
$$dU = \parfracii{U}{S}{V}{n_J} dS + \parfracii{U}{V}{S}{n_J} dV + \parfraciii{U}{n_i}{V}{S}{n_J} dn_i$$

$\mu_i = \parfraciii{U}{n_i}{V}{S}{n_J}$\
By similar approach, one can set up\
$\mu_i = \parfraciii{H}{n_i}{S}{P}{n_J}$

## The Gibbs - Duhem Equation

Before you read this section, read appendix for Euler equation. The do
the follwing excercise.\
[HW]{.underline}\
noticing the chemical potential is extensive (linear relation to size),
repeat the same procedure to obtain $U=TS-PV+\mu n_i$ for system
composed of a single chemical component.\
The argument can be generalized to m component system to produce
$U=TS-PV+\sum\limits_i\mu n_i$\
Using the definition of G(Legendre transformation), we obtain\
$G = \sum\limits_i \mu_i n_i \leftarrow$ another important eq.

$\Downarrow$

$$SdT - VdP + \sum\limits_in_id\mu_i = 0 \cdots \text{ Gibbs-Duhem Eq }$$

[HW]{.underline}\
Take differential of newly obtained
$G = \sum\limits_i \mu_i n_i \leftarrow$ and compare with original
expression of $dG$ from previous page(with natural variables) to obtain
The Gibbs - Duhem Equation.\
At const $T$ & $P$

$$\sum\limits_in_id\mu_i = 0$$

For binary mixture

$$n_ad\mu_a + n_bd\mu_b = 0$$

It shows that the chemical potential of one component

of a mixture can't change independently of the

other chemical components.

$$d\mu_b = -\frac{n_a}{n_b} d\mu_a = -\underset{\text{mole fraction}}{\underset{\uparrow}{\frac{\chi_a}{\chi_b}}}d\mu_a$$

##  Equation of State for Condensed Phase (Engineering Approach)

We have derived the equation of state for ideal gas and Van de Waals
gas. However, we did not discuss an equation of state for liquid or
solid because it does not exist. Even if it exists, it is not applicable
to the general case. Here, we cover the equation of state for condensed
phase for one of the limiting scenario.\
Thermal expansion coeff

$$\alpha = \frac{1}{V}\parfraci{V}{T}{P}$$

Compressibility

$$\kappa = -\frac{1}{V}\parfraci{V}{P}{T}$$

Using expansion coefficient.

$$\begin{align*}
\alpha dT &= \frac{1}{V}dV\\
&\text{Integrate both side}\\
\alpha\int_{T_0}^{T_1}dT &= \int_{V_0}^{V_1}\frac{1}{V}dV\\
\alpha(T-T_0) &= \ln\left(\frac{V}{V_0}\right)\\
V(T) &= V_0e^{\alpha(T-T_0)}\\
&\simeq V_0[1+\alpha(T-T_0)]
\end{align*}$$

[HW]{.underline}\
Obtain $V(P) = V_0[1-\kappa(P-P_0)]$.\
Combine these 2.\
$V(T) = V_0[1+\alpha(T-T_0)]$

$V_0(P) = V_\infty[1-\kappa(P-P_0)]$

$V(T,P) = V_\infty[1-\kappa(P-P_0)][1+\alpha(T-T_0)]$\

but this eq works okay for liq & solid.
