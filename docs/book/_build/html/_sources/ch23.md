# Reaction Dynamics and Kinetics 

\"Reaction Dynamics\" is a branch of physical chemistry which deals with
the motion of the system under the action of forces. This microscopic
study is often done in a computer simulation (quantum mechanically or
classically) and tracking motion of particles in the system (the system
could contain a large number of particles) can be quite tedious. In this
field of chemistry, many simulations are performed by combining
trajectory calculation and probability theory. However, time windows of
a simulation are often very short because a computational resource is
limited. Collision theory is useful because one can count the number of
chances that chemical reaction could happen without tracking all
particle motion in the system. \"Reaction Kinetics\" is a study of a
rate of reactions. Kinetics can be used to identify the reaction
mechanism as well as some information on transition state. Both Dynamics
and Kinetics are used to predict how fast the reaction proceeds in given
conditions.\

## Collision Theory

At the beginning of the semester, we derived\
M-B speed distribution.\
$$f(v) = 4\pi\left(\frac{m}{2\pi k_BT}\right)^{3/2}v^2e^{-\frac{mv^2}{2k_BT}}$$

We also obtained,

$$<v> = \left(\frac{8k_BT}{\pi m}\right)^{1/2}$$

From this point on, we will try to understand
$\left(\begin{tabular}{l} \text{mean free path  (MFP)}\\ \text{collision frequency ($z$)}\end{tabular} \right.$\
Since velocity of a particle is completely independent of other
particle's velocity (these vectors are orthogonal), relative speed is
expressed as\

Calcultate the frequency of N$_2-$N$_2$ collision in 1cm$^3$ at
20$^\circ$C, 1 bar, 80% N$_2$.

For total number of collision per unitvolume for two different molecule

Use $Z_{AB}=\sigma_{AB}<u_r>\rho_A\rho_B$ where
$\sigma_{AB} = \pi \left(\frac{d_A+d_B}{2}\right)^2$ and
$u_r=\left(\frac{8KT}{\pi \mu}\right)^{1/2}$.\
From this homework, you will see that the total collision frequency $>>$
the rate of any chemical reaction.

What is missing here?

Not all collisions lead to chemical reaction.

For example, collision energy must be larger than reaction barrier.\
Adding multi-physics, you will get to current [theoretical]{.underline}
model (Using computer simulation for few molecules).\
The topic gets too difficult for undergraduate level very quickly.\
However, this type of modeling offer the fundamental understanding of
general chemical reaction.\
Our approach for this class use experimental observations to bypass some
difficult part.

$$[A] = -kt + [A]_0$$

$\star$ 1st Order Reaction\

$$-\frac{d[A]}{dt} = k[A]$$

$$[A] = [A]_0e^{-kt}$$

###  2nd Order Reaction

$$-\frac{d[A]}{dt}=k[A]^2$$

$$\text{ or }$$

$$\frac{1}{[A]}=\frac{1}{[A]_0}+kt$$

Example: 2NO$_2 \longrightarrow$ 2NO + O$_2$.

Order maybe non-integer. Or order found in the experiment may not be
what you expect\.....\

$$\text{Rate } = k[A]^a \nwarrow \text{ This assumption works only for simple reaction. }$$

If that is the case, the reaction is not simple.

multiple steps

$\star$ Overall Second Order Reaction\
$$A + B \longrightarrow \text{Product}$$

$$\text{Rate } = \frac{d[A]}{dt} = -k([A]_0-x)([B]_0-x)$$

where $[A] = [A]_0-x$. Then,

$$\frac{dx}{dt} = k([A]_0-x)([B]_0-x)$$

$$\int\frac{1}{([A]_0-x)([B]_0-x)}dx = \int kdt \cdots \text{\circled{1}}$$

Using partial fraction (Calculus II),

$$\frac{1}{(a-x)(b-x)} = \frac{1}{b-a}\left(\frac{1}{a-x} - \frac{1}{b-x}\right)$$

becomes

$$\frac{1}{[B]_0-[A]_0}\left(\ln \frac{[A]_0}{[A]_0-x} - \ln \frac{[B]_0}{[B]_0-x}\right) = kt$$

$$kt = \frac{1}{[B]_0-[A]_0} \ln \left(\frac{[A]_0[B]}{[B]_0[A]}\right) //$$

Homework: For 0th, 1st, and 2nd order reaction ($A \rightarrow B$), how
long does it take to reduce $[A]_0$ to half, i.e.,
$[A]_0 = \frac{1}{2}[A]_0$ at time $t$. This is called the half life of
the reaction.

###  Reversible Reaction

&= -(k_f+k_r)A + k_r(A_0) \cdots \text{\circled{1}}
\end{align*}$$

The solution for this differential equation is

$$[A] = [A]_0\frac{k_r + k_f e^{-(k_f+k_r)t}}{k_r+k_f}$$

Homework: Take derivative to verify it is the solution.

At equilibrium, $\frac{dA}{dt} = 0$ and $t = \infty$.

$\Rightarrow [A] = \frac{k_r}{k_f+k_r}([A]_0)$.

$[B] = (A_0-A) = \frac{k_f}{k_f+k_r}A_0$

$K_\text{eq} = \frac{B}{A} = \frac{k_f}{k_r}//$

Example: Butene cis $\rightleftharpoons$ trans (First order in either
direction.)

$k_f = 4.21 \times 10^{-4} s^{-1}$

$K_\text{eq} = 0.406$

Starting with pure \[cis\] = 0.115 mol/L, how long does it take for a
half amount of trans compare to equilibrium?\
Homework: Solve this problem and answerthis question.

\"Doe the \[cis\]$_0$ matter at all?\"

### Temperature Dependence of Reaction Rate

For many reactions,\
$$A + B \longrightarrow AB^\ddagger \longrightarrow C$$

A and B have to collide to make AB$^\ddagger$.\
Let $Z$ be the frequency of collision (how often?) of A and B and $\rho$
be the steric factor for orientation dependent reaction.\
Then, the Arrhenius equation is rewritten by $$k = Ae^{-E_a/RT}$$ or\
$$=\underset{Z\rho}{\underset{\rotatebox{90}{=}}{A}}e^{-E_a/k_BT}$$

$Ea$ is called activation energy and it is the barrier height for the
forward reaction. Typical value of $E_a$ range from 50 to 200 kJ/mol.\

Example: To double the rate for some reaction at $T = 310K \cdots$ Body
Temperature and assume $E_a=100 kJ/mol$ for this reaction.

$$2 = \frac{k_2}{k_1} = \frac{\cancel{A}e^{-E_a/RT_2}}{\cancel{A}e^{-E_a/RT_1}}$$

You should get 315K.

Justification of Arrihenius Equation (intuitive version)

</p>
<figcaption>PES: Area under blue curve(Boltzmann Distribution)

</figure>

In order for a reaction to happen, reactant A and B must be close to
each other. We call this special form of reactant as \"AB complex\". The
probability of forming AB complex is usually determined by collision
theory and relate to pre-exponential factor in the Arrhenius Equation.
The only part of AB complex (energy of the complex must be higher than
$E_a$) can become a product. At the top (the saddle point) of the
potential energy surface along the reaction coordinate, Ab complex turns
into transition state (TS) and could become a product. In transition
state theory, any product formation must go through this transition
state. At transition state, the reaction coordinate must possess at
least $E_a$. Subsequent energy randomization leads to the formation of
products. Meanwhile, AB complex and transition state are assumed to be
in static equilibrium (Steady state). Therefore, we can obtain the ratio
of AB complex and TS by the statistical thermodynamics using state
counting. To simplify the argument, we assume that all vibrational and
rotational modes except one degree of freedom (the reaction coordinate)
are shared by AB-complex and TS. By statistical mechanical concept, we
can predict the ratio of reactant and product by counting the number of
accessible states (number of ways to distribute the energy into each
coordinate (modes)) for AB complex and TS. Since we can make all
vibrational modes and rotational modes to be completely independent of
each other, phase space volume can be computed as\
$$\text{ phase space of AB complex} :=V_AB= Q_{AB} \times R$$
$$\text{ phase space of TS}:=V_{TS}= Q_{TS} \times R$$ where Q represent
the number of way to randomize energy in the reaction coordinate and R
represent the one for the rest of the degree of freedom. Then, it
follows that,\
$$\frac{[TS]}{[\text{AB complex}]}=\frac{V_{TS}}{V_{AB}}=\frac{Q_{TS}}{Q_{AB}}$$
Now, assume both TS and AB complex obeys the Boltzmann distribution, we
get\
$$Q_{TS}= \sum\limits_{i}\frac{e^{-(\epsilon_i+E_a)\beta}}{\sum\limits_{i}e^{-(\epsilon_i)\beta}}$$
$$Q_{AB}= \sum\limits_{i}\frac{e^{-(\epsilon_i)\beta}}{\sum\limits_{i}e^{-(\epsilon_i)\beta}}$$
Therefore, the ratio\
$$\frac{[TS]}{[\text{AB complex}]}=\frac{\sum\limits_{i}e^{-(\epsilon_i+E_a)\beta}}{\sum\limits_{i}e^{-(\epsilon_i)\beta}}=e^{-E_a\beta}$$
Since the product concentration $[\text{Prod}]$, and the reactant
concentration $[\text{React}]$ is related bythe following formula,\
$$[\text{Prod}]=k[TS]$$
$$f[\text{React}]=[\text{AB complex}]   \cdots \text{f relates to collision frequency}$$
$$\frac{ [\text{Prod}]}{[\text{React}]}=  Ae^{-E_a\beta}=  Ae^{\frac{-E_a}{k_BT}}  \cdots \text{pre-exponential factor $A=kf$}$$

This ratio, $\frac{ [\text{Prod}]}{[\text{React}]}$ is different from
the corresponding thermodynamic ratio(equilibrium constant $K$) if there
is a distinct TS along the reaction coordinates. The ratio will be
identical to the thermodynamic ration if the reaction involves a
barrierless process. In the exothermic reaction, reverse reaction
becomes negligible, and RHS of the equation becomes a rate constant as
desired for Arrhenius rate constant.\

###  Reaction Mechanisms

The study of reaction rate often leads to an understanding of the
mechanisms of the reaction, their analysis into a sequence of elementary
steps.

$\frac{dP}{dt}=k_bI$ From A + I + P = A$_0 \leftarrow$ mass balance,

$P = \left\{1 + \frac{k_ae^{-k_bt}-k_be^{-k_at}}{k_b-k_a}\right\}A_0$

$\star$ Pre-equilibria ($k_r>>k_b$)\
Consider reaction:

$$A + B \underset{k_r}{\overset{k_f}{\rightleftharpoons}} I \overset{k_b}{\longrightarrow} P$$

$$k_\text{eq} = \frac{[I]}{[A][B]} = \frac{k_f}{k_r}$$

Then,\
$$\begin{align*}
\frac{dP}{dt} = k_bI &= \underbrace{k_bk_\text{eq}}AB\\
& \text{\hspace{10pt}}=K[A][B]
\end{align*}$$

\*This approximation only works if $k_r>>k_b$.\
Homework: Plot potential energy versus reaction coordinate that is
consistent with this mechanism.

$\star$ Kinetic Control (One reactant, multiple outcomes)

$$\begin{align*}
A \longrightarrow B & \hspace{50pt}\frac{dB}{dt} = k_1[A]\\
A \longrightarrow C & \hspace{50pt}\frac{dC}{dt} = k_2[A]
\end{align*}$$

$$\% B \text{ formed } = \frac{k_1}{k_1 + k_2} \text{ in general } \frac{k_i}{k_\text{tot}}$$

Product B or C can be favored depending on the condition.

<figcaption>Kinetic control: Low Temperature</figcaption>

At low T, Most of reactant do not have enough energy to overcome the
barrior for the formation of product A. Therefore, Porduct B with low
reaction barrior is favored. Thermodynamically more stable product A is
not significantly formed at this temperature. It is important to note
that almost no product can go back to reactant at this temperature
because required energy in the reaction coordinate are tend to be
absorbed by the heat bath.\

<figcaption>Kinetic control: High Temperature</figcaption>
</figure>

At high T, more reactant have enough energy to overcome the barrior for
the formation of product A. Therefore, the increase in the formation of
product A is observed by increasing the temperature of the system. Note
that Product B is still produced.\

you control the outcomes (like in the previous case)?

$$\begin{align*}
E_0 = E + (ES) &= \frac{k_M(ES)}{S} + (ES)\\
&= (ES) \left\{1 + \frac{k_M}{S}\right\}

Typically, $[S]>>E_0$ in biological environment ($[S]=[S]_0$)

then, $$(ES) = \frac{E_0}{1+\frac{k_M}{S_0}}$$

$$Rate = \frac{dP}{dt} = k_b(ES) = \frac{k_bE_0}{1 + \frac{k_M}{S_0}} \cdots \text{ The Michaelis-Menton equation }$$

$$\alpha = 1 + \frac{[I]}{k_I} \hspace{20pt} \alpha' = 1 + \frac{[I]}{K'_I}$$

$$E_0 = \alpha E + \alpha'(ES)$$

<hr/>
  $\begin{array}[t]{l} k_M = \frac{E\cdot S}{(ES)}\\ S\simeq S_0\end{array}$    $\Rightarrow$  $\begin{array}[t]{rl} E_0 &= \frac{\alpha k_M(ES)}{S_0} + \alpha'(ES) \\ &=\left(\frac{\alpha k_M}{S_0} + \alpha'\right)(ES)\\ & \Downarrow  \\ \frac{dP}{dt} = k_b(ES) &= \frac{k_bE_0}{\alpha \frac{k_M}{S_0}+\alpha'}// \end{array}$
