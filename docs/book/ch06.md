#  Electron Spin (Quantum Mechanics Concept)

Discovery of spin involved many experiments (Famous Stern-Gerlach
experiment) and theories by many scientists including Kronig, Pauli and
Dirac. Since physics relates to any of these is beyond the scope for
this class, we simply accept existence of intrinsic spin on electron.
Pauli's exclusion principle as well as Hund's rule follows as
consequences of electron spin. Property of spin also suggest usage of a
determinant to $\psi$ as a simplest approximation.

##  Electron Spin Angular Momentum

Each electron has an instrinsic form of angular momentum, called
\"spin\". $\leftarrow$ If you're interested in delving deeper into this
topic, I recommend exploring the Stern-Gerlach experiment and related
physics materials. It's worth noting that intrinsic spin angular
momentum cannot possess integer values, as there are no integer spins
that would yield two distinct orientations, consistent with the
experimental observation of electron deflection resulting in only two
distinct spots. It turns out that $1/2$ works for this case.\
Just like angular momentum (associated with orbital $\psi$ spatial)

$$\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
\widehat{L}^2 Y_l^m\big(\theta, \phi\big) &= \hbar^2l\big(l + 1\big)Y_l^m\big(\theta, \phi\big)\\
\widehat{L}_z Y_l^m\big(\theta, \phi\big) &= m\hbar Y_l^m\big(\theta, \phi\big)
\end{split}
\end{equation*}$$

$$\begin{tabular}{c|c}
$\widehat{S}^2\alpha = \frac{1}{2}\big(\frac{1}{2} + 1\big)\hbar^2\alpha$ & $ \widehat{S}^2\beta = \frac{1}{2}\big(\frac{1}{2} + 1\big)\hbar^2\beta$ \\
$\widehat{S}_z\alpha = m_s\alpha = \frac{1}{2}\hbar\alpha$ & $ \widehat{S}_z\beta = m_s\beta = -\frac{1}{2}\beta$
\end{tabular}$$

$\alpha$, $\beta$ are eigenfunctions.\
$m_s = \pm\frac{1}{2}$ are eigenvalues for $\widehat{S}_z$ operator.\
So, complete wavefunction is $\psi(x, y, z) \alpha$ or
$\psi(x, y, z)\beta$.\
Because $\frac{1}{2} \neq -\frac{1}{2}$, $\alpha \perp \beta$,\
$\int \alpha\beta d\omega = 0 \rightarrow$ electron spin coordinate\
Then, W. Pauli found crucial rule that was missing in quantum mechanics\
Postulate of quantum mechanics #6\
6⃝ All $\psi$ must be antisymmetric under interchange of any two $e^-$.
(Exclusion Principle)\
[i.e.]{.underline} If
$\psi = \phi_1(1)\phi_2(2) = 1S\alpha(1)1S\beta(2)$

$\hspace{60pt} \uparrow \hspace{60pt} || \hspace{30pt} \downarrow e^-$
are identical

orbital #2 $1S\alpha(2)1S\beta(1)$

occupied by

electron #1\
$\phi_1(1)\phi_2(2) \neq -\phi_2(1)\phi_1(2) \hspace{10pt} \Rightarrow\Leftarrow$

One way to satisfy Exclusion Principle is to antisymmetrize $\psi$.

$$\begin{equation*}
\psi\big(1, 2\big) = C_1\big[1\text{S}\alpha(1) 1S\beta(2) - 1S\beta(1)1S\alpha(2)\big]
\end{equation*}$$

$\uparrow$ normalization const $= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$\
Is $\psi(1, 2) = -\psi(2, 1)$?\
We can write $\xrightarrow{\text{orb}}$

$$\begin{equation*}
\psi\big(1, 2) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2!}}\begin{bmatrix} 1S\alpha(1) & 1S\beta(1)\\ 1S\alpha(2) & 1S\beta(2) \end{bmatrix} \downarrow e^-
\end{equation*}$$

$\uparrow$ \# $e^-$\
In General,

$$\begin{equation*}
\psi\big(1, 2, \cdots, N) = \frac{1}{N!}
 \begin{vmatrix} \phi_1(1) & \phi_2(1) & \cdots & \phi_N(1)\\
                           \phi_1(2) & \phi_2(2) & \cdots & \phi_N(2)\\
                           \vdots &                     & \ddots & \vdots \\
                          \phi_1(N) & \phi_2(N) & \cdots & \phi_N(N) \end{vmatrix}
\end{equation*}$$

Making wavefunction using single determinant is simple and used often in
the field of chmiestry and physics. This simple form of wavefunction is
called \"Slater determinant\". Determinant automatically satisfy the
Exclusion Principle because any raw swap will produce a multiplication
factor of (-1). [^1]\
[HW]{.underline}\
Show swapping electron 1 and 2 produce multiplication factor of (-1). If
general case is too difficult, then try 3x3 by hand. Create random 5x5
matrix having nonzero determinant in excel. You can manually swap raws
to see what happens as well.\
$$\begin{equation*}
 \frac{1}{N!}
 \begin{vmatrix} \phi_1(1) & \phi_2(1) & \cdots & \phi_N(1)\\
                           \phi_1(2) & \phi_2(2) & \cdots & \phi_N(2)\\
                           \vdots &                     & \ddots & \vdots \\
                          \phi_1(N) & \phi_2(N) & \cdots & \phi_N(N) \end{vmatrix} = -\frac{1}{N!}
 \begin{vmatrix} \phi_1(2) & \phi_2(2) & \cdots & \phi_N(2)\\
                           \phi_1(1) & \phi_2(1) & \cdots & \phi_N(1)\\
                           \vdots &                     & \ddots & \vdots \\
                          \phi_1(N) & \phi_2(N) & \cdots & \phi_N(N) \end{vmatrix}
\end{equation*}$$

## Consequence of Spin

### Sharing Four Quantum Numbers Is Not Allowed

Assume elec #1 & elec #2 occupy the same orbital, then,\
[Case]{.underline} 2$e^-$ system

$$\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
\psi\big(1, 2\big) &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2!}}\begin{vmatrix}1S\alpha(1) & 1S\alpha(1) \\ 1S\alpha(2) & 1S\alpha(2) \end{vmatrix}\\
& = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2!}}\big(1S\alpha(1)1S\alpha(2) - 1S\alpha(1)1S\alpha(2)\big)\\
&= 0 \hspace{40pt} \Rightarrow\Leftarrow
\end{split}
\end{equation*}$$

as we learned in General Chemistry I.\

### Other Consequence of Spin (Hunds Rule)

Hunds rule states that electrons in subshell tends to maximize spin. In
higher level physical chemistry class, you will learn that $e^-$ with
same spin tend to stay away from each other.\
$\Downarrow$\
Less repulsive interaction\
$\Downarrow$\
More stable $E_system$\
[i.e.]{.underline} N atom\

Hund's Rule

This HW part can be used as one laboratory experiment for the
demonstration of Hund's rule.\
[HW]{.underline}\
Write out the Hamiltonian operator for He atom in dimensionless form.
Then, separate this operator into 3 distinct operators. First one only
depends on electron 1 coordinate. Second one only depends on electronn 2
coordinate. Third operator(called two electron operator) depends on both
coordinate 1 and 2.\
[HW]{.underline}\
Let us consider the case for excite state of He where orbitals are px
and py. Construct Slater orbitals for the case both orbitals are spin
up. Then construct orbitals for the case px orbital is spin up but py
orbital is spin down. Expand the determinants for both cases.\
[HW]{.underline}\
Write out the complete Shrödinger Equation. Then, compute the
energy(This means you will need to write out E = blah blah) Substitute
hamiltonian operator as well as wave function. Expand the entire
equation. Be explicit on variables and sign.\
[HW]{.underline}\
In above question, identify the term which become zero after integrating
the term with respect to choice of variable. After eliminating all zero
terms, identify Coulomb interaction terms. The rest of two electron
integral term are called exchange terms. These are purely quantum
mechanical terms and there is no classical way to explain the exchange
terms. By the symmetry, these exchange integral is positive. With the
sign in front of the integral, these are known to stabilize the energy
of the system. With that in mind, explain how the Hund's rule works.\

# System Containing Only One Atom

As explained in previous chapter, it is difficult to compute repulsive
interactions between electrons since it rely heavily on neumerical
analysis techniques which is developed after the computer evolution.
Before that, multi-electron atomic system were studied in detail with
experimental result from atomic spectroscopy. We will follow this
approach because numerical approach is too involved for this textbook.
Just like in GC1, procedure is streamlined so you just need to follow
the procedure all the way through. Our goal for this chapter is to
introduce you the true Hund's rule which is not taught in GC1. At the
same time, we also introduce term symbol which is commonly used in the
field of spectroscopy.\

<hr/>

I start out with writing the electronic configuration in GC1 while we
have seen that actual wavefunction is a determinant. The best way to
relate the electronic configuration in GC1 to the corresponding
determinant is to write out only the diagonal part of the determinant.
There is a 1-1 correspondence so it is justified. So from here on, every
time we write the electronic configuration, it is understood that it is
a determinant. One of the possible $\psi$ to this example is

$\downarrow$ required anti-symmetry

$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\big[2s\alpha(1)2p_y\beta(2) - 2p_y\beta(1)2s\alpha(2)\big]$\
Now $\hat{l}_{z_i}$, $\hat{s}_{z_i}$ are not well defined

$\uparrow$ $\uparrow$

We can't really tell ($<l> = \frac{1}{2}$ is not allowed solution of the
differential equation. Each atomic orbitals, both radial and spherical
harmonic part, is only defined in specific integer value for set of
quantum numbers.)

[HW]{.underline}\
Write out the the other possible slater determinant wave functions for
given electronic configuration. Then, compute the total angular momentum
and total spin angular momentum for each of those possible wavefunctions
to convince yourself that they are well defined. This can be easily
proven logically by noticing each term in the determinant has same set
of orbitals.\
While $\hat{l}_{z_i}$, $\hat{s}_{z_i}$ are not well defined in
multi-electron atom(requiring the slater determinant),
$\underbrace{\widehat{L}_z, \widehat{L}^2, \widehat{S}_z, \widehat{S}^2}_{\text{total A.M. operator}}$
are well defined and will commute with $\widehat{H}$.

$$\begin{alignat*}
{3}
  &\widehat{L}^2\psi &&= L(L + 1)\hbar^2\psi &&\hspace{20pt} L = 0, 1, 2, \cdots\\
  &\widehat{L}_z\psi &&= M_L\hbar\psi &&\hspace{20pt}M_L = L, (L -1), \cdots, -(L - 1), -L \\
  &\widehat{S}^2\psi &&= S(S + 1)\hbar^2\psi &&\hspace{20pt} S = 0, \frac{1}{2}, 1, \frac{3}{2}, \cdots \\
  &\widehat{S}_z\psi &&= M_S\hbar\psi &&\hspace{20pt} M_S = S, S - 1, \cdots, -S
\end{alignat*}$$

While we do not use $\widehat{L}^2$ or $\widehat{S}^2$ in this chapter,
it is useful to think about the values of L and S which in turn
generates all $M_L$ values.

As shown in figure above, vector sum is used for setting the bound for
the length of the vector. To compute the vector sum, look for the
integer value of L that satisfy the following inequality.

$|l_1 - l_2| \le L \le l_1 + l_2$\

All six states will have different energy due to $e^--e^-$ repulsion.\
Hund's rulw will help us identify the lowest $E$ state.\
1⃝ G.S. will have the max value of $S$.

2⃝ If more than one term has max $S$ value, the max $L$ will be the
lowest among states with max $S$.\
[Ex]{.underline} Out of 6 states in previous [Ex]{.underline}, $^3D_g$
is the lowest $E$state.\
You can extend this method to $2p^13p^14p^1$ by applying procedure on
$2p^13p^1$ first, then resulting $L$, $S$, to $4p^1$. But we don't do
this in this class (because it is unlikely event to have
$2p^13p^14p^1$).

Procedure\
1⃝ Find max $M_L \rightarrow$ then choose max $M_S$ out of that set.

[i.e.]{.underline} $M_L = 2$

$M_S = 0$

2⃝ Cross out all the states that comes out of this $M_L$ & $M_S$.

[i.e.]{.underline}\
1st round $\times$\
2nd round $\bigtriangleup$\
3rd round $\square$\
3⃝ Repeat steps 1⃝ & 2⃝.

[i.e.]{.underline}

$$\begin{array}{ccccc}
& & & & M_L - 0 \hspace{5pt} M_S = 0\\
\begin{array}{c} M_L = 2\\ M_S = 0 \end{array} & ^1D_g & \begin{array}{c} M_L = 1\\ M_S = 1\end{array} & ^3P_g & ^1S_g\\
& \text{\textcircled{x}} & & \bigtriangleup & \square 
\end{array}$$

##  Adding Total Angular Momentum to the Term Symbol

We can define Total A.M. $$\begin{alignat*}
{3}
  &\widehat{J}^2\psi &&= J(J + 1)\hbar^2\psi &&\hspace{20pt} J = 0, \frac{1}{2}, 1, \frac{3}{2}, \cdots \\
  &\widehat{J}_z\psi &&= M_J\hbar\psi &&\hspace{20pt} M_J = J, J - 1, \cdots, -J
\end{alignat*}$$ $^{2S + 1}L_{J \leftarrow}$ total angular momentum
where $|L - S| \le J \le L + S$\
[Ex]{.underline}

$$\begin{array}{lclcl}
^3D & \xrightarrow{\begin{array}{l}S = 1\\L = 2\end{array}} & J = 3, 2, 1 & \Rightarrow & ^3D_3\hspace{5pt} ^3D_2 \hspace{10pt} ^3D_1\\
^4F & \xrightarrow{\begin{array}{l}S = \frac{3}{2}\\L = 3\end{array}} & J = \frac{9}{2}, \frac{7}{2}, \frac{5}{2}, \frac{3}{2} & \Rightarrow & ^4F_{\frac{9}{2}}\hspace{10pt}^4F_{\frac{7}{2}} \hspace{10pt} ^4F_{\frac{5}{2}} \hspace{10pt} ^4F_{\frac{3}{2}}
\end{array}$$

Hund's Rule\
3⃝ [[addition to rule 1⃝ & 2⃝]{.underline}]{.underline},\
subshell more than half filled $\rightarrow$ large $J$ is more stable\
subshell less than half filled $\rightarrow$ small $J$ is more stable

[Ex]{.underline} $2p^2$\
We found $^1D_g$, $^3P_g$, $^1S_g$\
by Hund's rule 1⃝ & 2⃝. $^3P_g$ is the most stable.\
Then, $^3P$ generates\
$$\begin{array}{ll}
\begin{array}{l} S = 1\\L = 1\end{array} & J = 2, 1, 0
\end{array}$$

$^3P_2$, $^3P_1$, $^3P_0$\
because less than half filled\
$^3P_0$ is the most stable.

Degeneracy w.r.t. $J$\
$^{2S + 1}L_J$\
$2J + 1$ states are in this term.

[i.e.]{.underline}\
$2P^1 \rightarrow ^2P_{3/2}$
$J = \frac{3}{2} \Rightarrow M_J = \underbrace{\frac{3}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, -\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{3}{2}}$

$4 = 2\big(\frac{3}{2}\big) + 1$

$^3D_3$ $J = 3 \Rightarrow M_J = 3, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2, -3,$

$7 = 3 \times 2 + 1$\
in $2P^2$ case, we found

$^1D_g$ $^3P_g$, $^1S_g$

## Term Symbols Are Useful for Atomic Spectroscopy

In the field of spectroscopy, we can observe transition that satisfy
selection rule.

[Selection Rule]{.underline}

$$\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
\Delta L &= \pm 1\\
\Delta S &= 0\\
\Delta J &= 0, \pm1
\end{split}
\end{equation*}$$

[Ex]{.underline}\
$$\begin{array}{ccccc}
^2S & \rightarrow & ^2S & not allowed & L = 0 \rightarrow L = 0 \\
^2S & \rightarrow & ^2D & not allowed & \Delta L = 2\\
^1S & \rightarrow & ^3S & not allowed & \Delta S = 1\\
^2S_{\frac{1}{2}} & \rightarrow & ^2P_{\frac{1}{2}} & allowed & \checkmark\\
\begin{array}{c}S = \frac{1}{2}\\ L = 0\\ J = \frac{1}{2}\end{array} & & \begin{array}{c}S= \frac{1}{2}\\ L = 1\\ J = \frac{1}{2}\end{array} & &   
\end{array}$$

[^1]: In general chemistry, we teach electron configuration such as
    $1s^22s$ One could argue that electron configuration we teach at
    general chemistry is actually a determinant and we are simply
    writing diagonal element of the determinant without providing them
    the explanation.
