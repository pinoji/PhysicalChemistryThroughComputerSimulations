# Simulations in Physica Chemistry: Laboratory Components

## Spectral Theorem: Linear Algebra Version

The spectral theorem states, \"If $n \times n$ matrix $A$ is real &
symmetric, then there will be $n$ independent eigenvectors & all
eigenvalues are real.\"\
This exercise will use Mathematica.\
Let us consider arbitrary picked real symmetric matrix. i.e. B

$$\begin{bmatrix} 1.0 & 2 & 3 & 4\\ 2 & 2 & 5& 6\\ 3 & 5 & 3 & 7 \\ 4 & 6 & 7 & 4 \end{bmatrix}$$

Note that I used floating numbers for at least one of the entries to
force Mathematica to perform numerical computations. Simply type the
following in the input line and shift enter to perform computation.\
First line will spit out all eigenvalues and second line will output all
eigenvectors.\
Note that all eigenvalues are real as you expected.\

Let's multiply matrix B times one of the eigenvectors (L.H.S. of the
eigenvalue equation)\
and multiply eigenvalue with the eigenvector (R.H.S. of the eigenvalue
equation) by typing the following.\

Repeat this procedure for all eigenvalue & eigenvector pairs.\
Lastly, we still need to check that the eigenvectors are orthogonal.
Compute the dot product of all possible pairs of eigenvectors. Are your
results consistent with the spectral theorem?

operator is closely related to Hamiltonian Operator $\hat H$ $=$
$\frac{\hat {L}^{2}}{2I}$ where I is the moment of inertia. You can use

## Hydrogen-Like Atomic System

This exercise will use Mathematica. Download the program from [Student
Associated
Files](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zvDKsBYDbdPKBXhqMDbAbWYRoqj_WrSR).\
Hydrogen-Like atom is a system containing only one electron orbiting
around nucleus. Therefore, this system is solvable and the exact
solution to this problem is given by the product of radial wave function
and spherical harmonics we studied so far. Because Mathematica can
convert spherical polar coordinate to Cartesian coordinate, we can
repeat the same problem using simple Cartesian coordinate system.
Understanding how the actual code for this coordinate transformation
works is out of scope for this class. Therefore, the automated radial
wave function and spherical harmonics are encoded and attached to your
Mathematica file. Because swapping coordinate system does not affect the
outcome, we should obtain the same solutions, and their eigenvalues
obtained by using spherical polar coordinate system. To complete this
exercise, you will need to check orthogonality of the solutions. (Pick 5
random cases) Check all the orbitals for normalization. Also, obtain the
average distance away from the center; for example, Bohr radius for 1s
orbital of the Hydrogen atom. Compute the energy of all the orbitals. To
do this in Cartesian coordinate, you need to compute\
$$\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
& E =\int\int \int \psi^{*}(x,y,z) \hat {H}\psi(x,y,z) dxdydz \\
& =\int\int \int \psi^{*}(x,y,z) \left(  \frac{-1}{2} \nabla^2- \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}} \right)\psi(x,y,z) dxdydz  \\
\end{split}
\end{equation*}$$ Do this for all orbitals up to 4f. (this is an art so
use pptx and excel wisely) I want orbital pictures as an insert art.

## $H_2^{+}$ System

This exercise will use Mathematica. Download the program from [Student
Associated
Files](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zvDKsBYDbdPKBXhqMDbAbWYRoqj_WrSR).\
$H_2^{+}$ is a system containing only one electron orbiting around two
nuclei (one electron non-central body problem). Assume wave function is
a simple combination of 1S orbitals from both H atoms. Because we only
deal with linear operators, we can describe this system by just simply
computing Coulomb and Exchange integral at given nuclear separation in
addition to isolated H atom. The definitions of Exchange (K) and Coulomb
(J) integral in this problem are given as follows. If only one orbital
is involved in the integrand, then it is Coulomb, and Exchange
otherwise. Vary the atomic separation from 1 to 4, plot out the
contributions of J, K and total energy for this system. Calculate J & K
to estimate the energy of the system with $\psi_+$ and $\psi_-$. Plot
the energy diagram and predict the bond length.

## Hybrid Orbitals

This exercise will use Mathematica. Download the program from [Student
Associated
Files](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zvDKsBYDbdPKBXhqMDbAbWYRoqj_WrSR).\
Hybrid orbitals are often used in Organic chemistry as well as Inorganic
chemistry. Using the formula in the related section of the textbook,
create $sp$ hybrid orbitals. Check orthonormality of
$\left\{\psi_{sp\pm}\right\}$. Then, proceed to make $sp^2$ hybrid
orbitals.

## Term Project: Group Theory on Electronic Transition

If you do not understand any word, look for it online (AI will do the
job). In many field of chemistry, you will hear $\pi$ to $\pi^{*}$
transition as well as $n$ to $\pi^{*}$ transition (lone pair to exited
MO of particular kind). In this exercise, you will learn these important
transitions from physical chemistry point of view. So the tool we will
use for this project is a group theory. You might want to review the
lecture notes or read the relevant section of the textbook. In this
project, you will study formaldehyde ($CH_2O$) which includes $sp^{2}$
hybridized orbitals on C and O atoms. You can symmetrize these hybrid
atomic orbitals centered at C and O by the procedures given in the
textbook.\

### Project Procedure

1st step \[100pts\] Answer these in typed report\
1) Identify the symmetry of $CH_2O$\
2) Create character table (copy it from textbook) for this point group\
3) Draw a figure of the $sp^{2}$ hybridized orbitals. (This could be a
repeat of the previous laboratory). Note $P_x$ orbital is sticking out
of the paper. Use the subscript o and c represent Oxygen and Carbon,
respectively.\
4) Using the method described in the textbook, predict irreducible
representation of these orbitals.\
5) Using generating operator, create symmetry adopted molecular orbitals
(it is not completely done yet)\
6) Realizing orbital with same symmetry will have positive overlap,
identify molecular orbitals involved in the formation of a $\sigma$ bond
along C-O bond using symmetry adopted MO\
7) Similarly, identify molecular orbitals involved in the formation of a
$\pi$ bond along C-O bond\
8) Our discussion from this point will focus on C=O part. So we need to
identify and eliminate orbitals used in $\sigma$ bond along C-H bond.
Realize that these have to be singly occupied\

2nd step (hybridization and assigning irreducible representation )\
Oxygen atom\
Using 2s, $2p_z$ and $2p_y$ orbitals, create new set of orbitals consist
of sp2 hybrid orbitals and px (note: any combination of orbitals will
result in new orbitals. In that process, total energy must be conserved.
(i.e. sum of $E_{2s}$+2$E_{2p}$=3$E_{sp^{2}}$) Fill in electron from the
bottom(aufbau principle) while keeping total number of unpaired
electrons to be 2. This number tend to equal number of covalent bonds
for non radical molecules.\
Carbon atom\
Rrepeat the same procedure, but set the total number of unpaired
electron to be 4.\

Make sure to explain these in no more than few sentences each (keep it
short) same as step 1 question\
Each single electron occupying the orbital can form a chemical bond but
not those electrons in doubly occupied orbitals. (explain.)\
Also, which of the following orbital can overlap to make a bond? (px
with px? or hybrid with hybrid?)\
From your experience in previous computer simulation, which bond is more
stable in terms of energy? (bond made by px with px? or hybrid with
hybrid?)\
Which one become sigma or pi bond? Which one become lone pair? Are those
doubly occupied?\
Type of MO you are going to generate and thier irrep (irreproducible
representation)\
Identify the AO belongs to which irrep?\
Do you think these keep the shape when it become true Molecular
orbitals? If not, which orbitals are likely to mix? (explain this in
detail)\
3rd step \[record data and extract info in typed report for instructor
100 points\]\
This step require HyperChem program. To set you as user, go to c drive
hyper80. Program then run Newuser80 (this must be done before you open
HyperChem)\
Draw molecular orbital diagram with the assist of computational
program.\
(Note: Only same symmetry will mix \[form bonds\] ----- you can think in
terms of integral)\
1) Using Hyperchem, optimize the geometry with ab initio HF/6-31G\*
level\
2) After you are done with optimization\
Go to file tab and "Start log" at this moment (you will use this file
later)\
3) Perform single point CI (using singly excited) When you compute, make
sure to set the orbital criterion to occupied=3 unoccupied=5\
4) After computation, compute orbital (just 3D plotting orbital)\
Make sure to highlight the number and start from 1. Push \[plot\]
button\
5) Watch the display of orbitals and record symmetry of orbital (also
check it in your head as well) $\&$ orbital energy\
6) Now change the orbital $\#$ to 2 and push \[plot\], record symmetry.
Repeat this until you reach orbital $\#$ 12\
7) List out all occupied orbitals and make a Figure (attach the small
orbital picture)\
Your output look like this\
Orbital symmetries:\
Occupied (A1)(A1) etc\
Virtual (A1)(B2) etc\
8) Using the energy of the MO, you can construct molecular orbital
diagram.Your diagram shoud look like this.\
$$\begin{array}{l|l}
A_1 & 0_o, 0_c, \frac{1}{2}(1_o + 2_o), \frac{1}{2}(1_c + 2_c)\\
\hline
B_1 & P_{x_o}, P_{x_c}\\
\hline
B_2 & \frac{1}{2}(1_o -2_o), \frac{1}{2}(1_c - 2_c)
\end{array}$$

4th step.\[application to Molecular spectroscopy 50 pts for typed up
report\]\
It is possible to excite any electrons in occupied orbitals to
unoccupied orbitals. We want to determine the symmetry type (irreducible
representation of total wave function $\psi$) Rule: Consider
multiplication of function f and function g. symmetry operation on fxg
will be predicted by multiplying the value in the character table. i.e.
product of function falls under B2 multiplied by another under B1 will
produce A2\

Electronic transition can be achieved by applying EM radiation. With a

$\searrow$ having component in $x, y, z$.\
for molecule with $C_{2v}$ symmetry (CH$_2$O)\

<hr/>  $x = B_1$
  $y = B_2$
  $z = A_1$
<hr/>
To become excited state,\
$\int\psi_{GR} r\psi_{EX} dr$ must have $A_1$ symmetry.\
$\psi_{GR}$ for Formaldehyde is
$\underbrace{\text{closed shell molecular orbital}}_{\text{means }A_1}$.\
Now, consider transition of exciting $\pi$ bonding orbital to $\pi$
anti-bonding orbital ($B_1$ to $B_1^\star$)\
note that initial ground state has all molecular orbitals completely
filled (A1)\
considertriple product $\psi_{ini}\times dipole \times \psi_{fin}$ along
$z$ $A_1 \times A_1 \times(B_1 \times B_1)= A_1$\
$\uparrow$

$z$ along $z$ $A_1 \times B_2 \times(B_1 \times B_1)= B_2$\
along $z$ $A_1 \times B_1 \times(B_1 \times B_1)= B_1$\
Any efficient transition must have $A_1$ for triple product, $\pi$ to
$\pi^\ast$ transition is allowed along $z$ direction.\
Other directions are forbidden\
Overall $\pi-\pi^\ast$ transition occurs. (efficiently)

Consider exciting lone pair $e^-$ to $B_1^\ast$

(non bonding)

ignoring filled orbital $\psi = B_2'B_1 = A_2$\
Triple product

$$\begin{array}{ll}
x & A_1  \times B_1\times A_2 = B_2\\
y & A_1  \times B_2\times A_2 = B_1\\
z & A_1  \times A_1\times A_2 = A_2
\end{array}$$

So, this transition is forbidden. In real experiment, there may be a
very weak $n-\pi^\ast$ transition, but require highre level Physicaal
Chemistry.\
5th Step \[extract data and type up the report for instructor 50 pts \]\
Open the log file you saved for CI calculation. It contains all the
electronic transition with oscillator strength (peak intensity). Now
using all of the techniques introduced here and information available
from computational program(Hyperchem), discuss all the electronic
transition possible. Write out the complete procedure used with
figures.\
Entire report should not exceed 8 pages.
